 First complete Unity game. Probably 100% finished, it's not great but it's mostly here just for the sake of having something here.

## Instructions

Double click the exe file (not a viruz, trust me bro)

Move character with WASD
Move camera with mouse
Space to jump (kinda wonky)

Collect all the spheres in 30 seconds.
